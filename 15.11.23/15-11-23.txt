Prop drilling: Prop drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children. This process can continue indefinitely. At the end, it's a long chain of component dependencies that can be difficult to manage and maintain.
Context API: Context API allows data to be passed through a component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. This makes it easier to share data between components.
import React from 'react';
const contextInstance = React.createContext(initialValue);
Parent Component:
<contextInstance.Provider value={information}>
    <ChildComponent/>
</contextInstance.Provider> 
Child Component:
import { useContext } from 'react';
const data = useContext(contextInstance);
