1. let and const keyword:
> This acts like block scope variables, were value of variable can be accessable within the block.
    Syntax
        let variableName = value;
        const variableName = value;
> Using let we can assign the value for multiple times whereas using const we can assign it for once.
2. Array helper functions
forEach: Used to iterate through each of value of the array.
    Syntax:
        arrayName.forEach(function(value, index, arrayName) {
            // Logic...
        })
        value - Returns the current iteration value - Mdndate
        index - Returns the index of current iteration - Optional
        arrayName - Returns the array data - Optional
        
Callback Function: A function which is passed as a parameter to another function is called as callback function.
