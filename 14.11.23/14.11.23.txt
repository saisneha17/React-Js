Hooks:

useState()

> In React, useState is a hook that allows functional components to manage state. Before the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, state management was primarily done in class components. With the advent of hooks, functional components can now manage state using the useState hook.

    Syntax:

        const [variableName, setVariableName] = useState(initialValue);

The useState function is used to declare state variables in functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.


var a = 10;

a = 20
